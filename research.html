            <h3>Estrous Phase Classification</h3>
            <p>Taking the dataset I published in the mEPSC Dataset Project, I utilized various Python packages
              to import the data into google colab, make it useable, and filter it. A variety of biological signal types (spiking, 
              mEPSC, and passive membrane potential) were explored. I then tested the model accuracies
              of various machine learning algorithms across features extracted from the different signal types, indicating which
              signal type encodes the state of estrous cycle phase best. This more broadly represents an exploration of how best to 
              computationally represent small scale neuromodulatory differences in cells within the brain. Next steps are in the works...

              South East (SYNAPSE) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in March of this year. I was also selected to give
              a short talk about the project which you can listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/9Q5Z3TM_CLA">here</a> if you are interested.

            <p>As part of my first project in the <a href="https://meitzenlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/team/"> Meitzen lab</a> I used a simple Python script to
            automate the merging of many excel spreadsheets into a dataset with data from two papers which I manually cleaned. I gained a lot of knowledge about
            how to read academic papers and understand what is important amongst a lot of jargon during this time.</p>

              we can poke singular neurons and figure out what they are up to.</p>

            <p>I am assigned to a PhD student working in Dr. Helen Huang's lab on applications of reinforcement learning in EMG based upper-limb prosthetics. Thus far alongside
              general help with literature review, I have worked on fixing the eye tracking glasses pictured to the left, conducted extensive research
              on optimal using of my university's high powered computing lab, worked on multithreading/ vectorizing RL environments for increased efficiency,
               and helped with prosthetics demonstrations/ general duties during open houses. 
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>I've learned a lot about topics beyond my project including basics about exoskeletons, hip prosthetics, and how deocding paradigms
              differ for those from upper limb. I'm also in the process of being trained to help out with participant facing research.

              substantial modifications to stereotactic depth electrodes to enhance their functionality while retaining their core purpose under Dr. Eric Leuthardt. I learned
              so much about FDA regulations/ pathways for medical devices, the differences in how neurosurgeons and engineers communicate, and the importance
              of observing before you build. I had the exciting opportunity to watch neurosurgery, work with very fancy 3D printers, and speak with experts from
              so many different domains.

            <p>This experience was very different from what I'm used to, I was unable to write a single 
              line of code. I was instead forced to step out of my comfort zone and do a lot of a new kind of learning. 
              I also took advantage of the nearby amtrak station to make visits to Chicago and Kansas City alongside exploring 
              as much of St. Louis as possible.

            human factors psychology. I used JSON files and a git package called omrchecker to build outlines to accurately record data from paper surveys,
            manually QAd paper forms, and helped with literature review on topics including human-robot anthropomorphism, optimal learning conditions,
            and the effects of different distractions on specific tasks.</p>

              It was my first time preparing and presenting research and taught me lots about the pace at which research moves and the importance
              of patience.
