            <h3>Estrous Phase Classification</h3><h4><em>Feb. 2025 -- Present</em></h4>
            <p>Taking the dataset I published in the mEPSC Dataset Project, I utilized various Python packages
              to import the data into google colab, make it useable, and filter it. After that I extracted experimental
              features to compare against the features of the mEPSC events generated by MiniAnalysis. Comparing the model accuracies
              of various machine learning algorithms, we determined the best features to classify Estrous cycle phase with.
              This more broadly represents an exploration of how best to computationally represent small scale neuromodulatory differences
              in cells within the brain. Next steps are in the works...

              The picture to the left is from the poster I presented at the Symposium for Young Neuroscientists and Professors of the
              South East (SYNAPSE) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in March of this year. I was also selected to give
              a short talk about the project which you can listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/9Q5Z3TM_CLA">here</a> if you are interested.

            <p>As part of my first project in the <a href="https://meitzenlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/team/"> Meitzen lab</a> I used a simple Python script to
            automate the merging of many excel spreadsheets into a dataset with data from two papers which I manually cleaned. I gained a lot of knowledge about
            how to read academic papers and understand what is important amongst a lot of jargon during this time. Knowing what I do now, I am
            thoroughly dissapointed in the lack of laziness I incorporated into my strategy for this project. If you are interested in accessing the
            dataset you can do so by following <a href="https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.k0p2ngfgm"> this link</a>.</p>

            <p>On the left is a picture of me working on the computer in the patch-clamp rig room in the lab. It's pretty crazy to think that
              we can poke singular neurons and figure out what they are up to.</p>

            <h3>Human-Robot Autonomy Teaming</h3><h4><em>Aug. 2023 -- Nov. 2023</em></h4>
            <p>My first ever research experience was with the <a href="https://acmclaug.wordpress.ncsu.edu/">LACELab</a> in the department of
            human factors psychology. I used JSON files and a git package called omrchecker to build outlines to accurately record data from paper surveys,
            manually QAd paper forms, and helped with literature review on topics including human-robot anthropomorphism, optimal learning conditions,
            and the effects of different distractions on specific tasks.</p>

            <p>To the right is a picture of me at the State of North Carolina Undergraduate Research and Creativity Symposium (SNCURCS) 2023 meeting.
              It was my first time preparing and presenting research and taught me lots about the pace at which research moves and the importance
              of patience.
