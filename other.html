      <h2>Caldwell Fellows Program - NC State</h2>
      <p>As a Caldwell Fellow, I've had the opportunity to engage in meaningful service-learning experiences that combine academic growth with community impact.
      Here are a few of my favorite experiences:</p>

          <h3>Center for Creative Leadership</h3>
          <p>This past fall break, I had the opportunity to attend the Center for Creative Leadership in Greensboro, NC with my cohort of fellows. 
            I learned a lot about different leadership styles and how to lean into my personal strengths during my time there.

          <h3>Interfaith Food Shuttle Farm</h3>
          <p>My time with the Interfaith Food Shuttle Farm taught me so much about the difficulties of growing fresh produce at scale.
            It gave me a new appreciation for the work that goes into growing food without pesticides, herbicides, or a large team of people.
            Spending hours fanning through cabbage leaves looking for worms, mulching the shallow roots of blueberry trees, and spreading
            wheel barrows of leaf mulch on fields (and in my shoes) has changed the way I see a fully stocked grocery store forever.
            Interfaith has pantries and farms across central North Carolina, I'd highly encourage anyone local to spend a day with them.
            Check out their website <a href="https://interfaithfoodshuttle.org/">here</a>.

      <h2>Pack Bionics</h2>
      <p>From August 2023 - December 2024, I was a member of the software subteam working on simulations and 
        data analysis for prosthetic leg development.

      <h2>TA - Neurobiology</h2>
      <p>As a Teaching Assistant for Neurobiology, I created interactive 3D visualizations to help students better understand complex neural concepts. Here are two Web VPython programs I developed:</p>

      <h3>Optic Nerve Transections</h3>
      <p>This interactive visualization demonstrates the effects of optic nerve transections on visual pathways.</p>
