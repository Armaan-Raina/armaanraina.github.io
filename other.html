      <h2>Caldwell Fellows Program - NC State</h2>
      <p>As a Caldwell Fellow, I've had the opportunity to engage in meaningful service-learning experiences that combine academic growth with community impact.
      Here are a few of my favorite experiences:</p>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Center for Creative Leadership - Greensboro, NC</h3>

          <h3>Interfaith Food Shuttle Farm</h3>
          <p>My time with the Interfaith Food Shuttle Farm taught me so much about the difficulties of growing fresh produce at scale.
            It gave me a new appreciation for the work that goes into growing food without pesticides, herbicides, or a large team of people.
            Spending hours fanning through cabbage leaves looking for worms, mulching the shallow roots of blueberry trees, and spreading
            wheel barrows of leaf mulch on fields (and in my shoes) has changed the way I see a fully stocked grocery store forever.
            Interfaith has pantries and farms across central North Carolina, I'd highly encourage anyone local to spend a day with them.
            Check out their website <a href="https://interfaithfoodshuttle.org/">here</a>.
