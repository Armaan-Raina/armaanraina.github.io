          <h1>Estrous Phase Classification</h1><h4><emph>Feb. 2025 -- Present</emph></h4>
          <p>Taking the dataset I published in the mEPSC Dataset Project, I utilized various Python packages
            to import the data into google colab, make it useable, and filter it. After that I extracted experimental
            features to compare against the features of the mEPSC events generated by MiniAnalysis. Comparing the model accuracies
            of various machine learning algorithms, we determined the best features to classify Estrous cycle phase with. 
            This more broadly represents an exploration of how best to computationally represent small scale neuromodulatory differences 
            in cells within the brain. Next steps are in the works...

            The picture to the left is from the poster I presented at the Symposium for Young Neuroscientists and Professors of the 
            South East (SYNAPSE) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in March of this year. I was also selected to give
            a short talk about the project which you can listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/9Q5Z3TM_CLA">here</a> if you are interested.

          <h2>Interfaith Food Shuttle Farm</h2>
          <h4><emph>Aug. 2024 -- Dec. 2024</emph></h4>
          <p>My time with the Interfaith Food Shuttle Farm taught me so much about the difficulties of growing fresh produce at scale.
            It gave me a new appreciation for the work that goes into growing food without pesticides, herbicides, or a large team of people.
            Spending hours fannning through cabbage leaves looking for worms, mulching the shallow roots of blueberry trees, and spreading
            wheel barrows of leaf mulch on fields (and in my shoes) has changed the way I see a fully stocked grocery store forever.
            Interfaith has pantries and farms across central North Carolina, I'd highly encourage anyone local to spend a day with them.
            Check out their website <a href="https://interfaithfoodshuttle.org/">here</a>.

            as part of the <a href="https://caldwellfellows.ncsu.edu/">Caldwell Fellows Program</a>.</p>

          <h2>Schizophrenia EEG Classification</h2><h4><emph>June 2024 -- Aug. 2024</emph></h4>
          <p>This project was my introduction into the interaction of ML and neuroscience. Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BdBJOOqMes&list=PLtGXgNsNHqPTgP9wyR8pmy2EuM2ZGHU5Z">
          Talha Anwar's series</a> on applying machine learning to EEG data, I learned how to make EEG into tabular, usable data and process signals in python. Beyond the videos, explored the use of power
          spectral density as a powerful feature in the classification task. This project helped me refine my data science skills and opened my mind to 
          the possibilities of using Python for neuroscience. Check out my Github for the code! </p>

          <p>On the left is a picture of me with my first ever EEG headset, gifted to me by a mentor. Tinkering with it
            taught me a great deal about the challenges of working with EEG data, the importance of signal processing, and 
            the crazy amount of setup needed for a quality recording.

          <h2>mEPSC Dataset Publication</h2><h4><emph>Jan. 2024 -- Mar. 2024</emph></h4>
          <p>As part of my first project in the <a href="https://meitzenlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/team/"> Meitzen lab</a> I used a simple Python script to 
          automate the merging of many excel spreadsheets into a dataset with data from two papers which I manually cleaned. I gained a lot of knowledge about 
          how to read academic papers and understand what is important amongst a lot of jargon during this time. Knowing what I do now, I am 
          thorouhgly dissapointed in the lack of laziness I incorporated into my strategy for this project. If you are interested in accessing the 
          dataset you can do so by following <a href="https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.k0p2ngfgm"> this link</a>.</p>

          <br><br>
          <p>On the right is a picture of me working on the computer in the patch-clamp rig room in the lab. It's pretty crazy to think that 
            we can poke singular neurons and figure out what they are up to.</p>

          <h2>Human-Robot Autonomy Teaming</h2><h4><emph>Aug. 2023 -- Nov. 2023</emph></h4>
          <p>My first ever research experience was with the <a href="https://acmclaug.wordpress.ncsu.edu/">LACELab</a> in the department of
          human factors psychology. I used JSON files and a git package called omrchecker to build outlines to accurately record data from paper surveys, 
          manually QAd paper forms, and helped with literature review on topics including human-robot anthropomorphism, optimal learning conditions, 
          and the effects of different distractions on specific tasks.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>To the left is a picture of me at the State of North Carolina Undergraduate Research and Creativity Symposium (SNCURCS) 2023 meeting. 
            It was my first time preparing and presenting research and taught me lots about the pace at which research moves and the importance
            of patience.
