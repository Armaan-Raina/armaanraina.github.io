            <h2>Cofounder - Neurotech at NC State</h2>
            <p>As cofounder of <a href="https://ncsuneurotech.org/" target="_blank" class="dataset-link">Neurotech at NC State</a>, I have helped recruit over 25 curious and amazing students with majors ranging from electrical engineering to business to collaborate with us on projects.
            I've also led grant writing efforts resulting in over $4,000 of free hardware being donated to our club. Another thing I've helped with is
            idea drafting for projects we are working on, supporting members and my other two cofounders in developing some very cool ideas. Lastly, I've handled the adminstrative side of things by making us a
            bank account, student org page, and setting up collaborations with other organizations.   </p>

            <h2>Schizophrenia EEG Classification</h2>
            <p>This project was my introduction into the interaction of ML and neuroscience. Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BdBJOOqMes&list=PLtGXgNsNHqPTgP9wyR8pmy2EuM2ZGHU5Z">
            Talha Anwar's series</a> on applying machine learning to EEG data, I learned how to make EEG into tabular, usable data and process signals in python. Beyond the videos, explored the use of power
            spectral density as a powerful feature in the classification task. This project helped me refine my data science skills and opened my mind to
            the possibilities of using Python for neuroscience. Check out my Github for the code! </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>On the right is a picture of me with my first ever EEG headset, gifted to me by a mentor. Tinkering with it
              taught me a great deal about the challenges of working with EEG data, the importance of signal processing, and
              the crazy amount of setup needed for a quality recording.
